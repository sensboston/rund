It's a pretty small utility to run Windows console app hidden. You may use it, for example, for https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards because standard pythonw.exe has some issues.

You may add a daily task to the Task Scheduler. For example, command line for BingRewardsBot should looks like `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c python.exe main.py`
